\subsection{Detailed Description}
Type-\/safe data which can be shared between tasks in a thread-\/safe manner. 

This file contains a template class for data which is to be shared between classes. The data must be protected against damage due to context switches, so it is protected by a mutex or by causing transfers to take place inside critical sections which are protected from being interrupted.

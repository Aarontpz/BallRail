\subsection{Detailed Description}
Source code of a base class for type-\/safe, thread-\/safe task data exchange classes. 

Headers for a base class for type-\/safe, thread-\/safe task data exchange classes.

This file contains a base class for classes which exchange data between tasks. Inter-\/task data must be exchanged in a thread-\/safe manner, so the classes which share the data use mutexes or mutual exclusion mechanisms to prevent corruption of data. A linked list of all inter-\/task data items is kept by the M\+E405 system, and this base class contains members that handle that linked list.
